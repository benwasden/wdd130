            <p>Hi! I'm Benjamin Wasden and I'm from California. I live around San Francisco and I absolutely love the bay area. There's many places to hike, explore, and visit and I've lived here my whole life. It doesn't rain a whole lot here but when it does, it pours. I like drawing and anything tech! I've worked as an I.T. Technician for several years but Software development has always interested me. I'm also a musician. Music was originally what I planend to get my degree in, but I changed my mind several years back. After trying out cybersecurity, I decided that software development would be a better fit for me. I.T. has been good for me as well, but I want to pursue a new avenue. For those reasons and more, I'm going to continue to try to finish my Bachelors.</p>

            <p>California is the western most state in the contiguous United States. It's incredibly large, spanning nearly 800 miles from north to south. To the east is Nevada, and to the west is the Pacific Ocean. Because of its size, California has a wide variety of biomes such as beaches, mountains, forests, deserts, and more.</p>
