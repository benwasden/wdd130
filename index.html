        <p>California is the western most state in the contiguous United States. It's incredibly large, spanning nearly 800 miles from north to south. To the east is Nevada, and to the west is the Pacific Ocean. Because of its size, California has a wide variety of biomes such as beaches, mountains, forests, deserts, and more.</p>
