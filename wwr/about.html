                <h2>History</h2>
                <div class="history-pi">
                    <p>Rapids at Full Throttle began as an idea, a desire to share the appreciation of nature our founders had grown. The outdoors are wonderful in every sense of the word, and the beautiful locales of Northern California are among the best to visit in the world. While our founders have traveled all over the globe, they decided to settle in this beautiful spot. From here, they met others who shared the same views as them. We have passion for the outdoors and for the beauty of California especially. As our founders met and interacted with other like-minded people, we decided to organize into a proper company to share that passion with everyone!</p>
                    <img src="images/river.jpg" alt="River surrounded by land on both sides">
                    <p>California has a multitude of beautiful locations to pick from. This made it extremely difficult to narrow our selection down to only a few. The places we selected (high up in the Sierras, Point Reyes, and Lake Tahoe) are some of the most stunningly beautiful locations in the world. Not only do they provide excellent rivers to raft down, they contain beautiful forests, mountain landscapes, and views you can't get anywhere else. All of our trips are within only a few hours of each other, and each of them provide variety and an equal amount of beauty. Simply decide how long you have to be with us and what kind of challenge you're in the mood for. We'd love to have you!</p>
